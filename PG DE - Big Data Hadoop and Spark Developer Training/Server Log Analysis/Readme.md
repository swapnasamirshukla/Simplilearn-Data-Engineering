# Server Log Analysis

## Description

### Problem Statement

Apache services such as Hadoop, Spark, Tomcat, and Hive are widely used on data engineering servers worldwide. Despite their diverse functionalities, these services follow similar logging patterns as they are open-source.

With your expertise in Hadoop and log analysis, you aim to dissect server logs containing critical information such as:

1. Details on the resources that were used.
2. The identity of the person who accessed the logs.
3. The date and time the logs were accessed.
