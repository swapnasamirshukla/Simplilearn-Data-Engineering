# Project 2: Home Insurance System
## Course-end Project 2

### Description

Create a Java project to develop a Home Insurance System which deals with policy quotation and other policy-related operations.

### Background of Problem Statement

Home Insurance is a system that helps in buying insurance for a home through a web application. Currently, users need to visit the insurance office to get a quote before buying a policy by providing Home Owner Details, Location Details, and Property Details to the employee of the insurance company. The employee reviews the provided details and gives a quote to the user. If the user is satisfied with the quote, they proceed to buy the policy. This manual process is time-consuming and involves a lot of workflows.

A new system is required to automate the existing manual processes to make the system more efficient and cost-effective. Using this application, a registered user can get a quote before buying an insurance policy by providing details such as homeowner location, homeowner details, and property details.

### Functionalities to be Implemented

- User Registration
- Getting a Quote
- Retrieving an Existing Quote
- Buying a Policy
- Viewing a Policy
- Renewing a Policy
- Cancelling a Policy

### Integrated Application Features

1. User registration and login.
2. Only registered users and administrators can access the application.
3. At any point, the user should be able to go back to the homepage.
4. Create a session for every login.
5. If the username and password do not exist in the system, the application should show a proper error message.
6. Apply at least Not Null and Character length validations to the forms.
