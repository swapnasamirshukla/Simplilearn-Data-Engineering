# Description

To build the solution using Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

## Prerequisites:

- OOPS
- Java

## Description:

This assignment is designed to help understand working with OOPS in Java and how the polymorphic behavior can be implemented.

## Problem Statement:

Yamin is a Gym Instructor. He takes multiple sessions of Zumba during the day, for which he has divided his participants into batches running in the morning and evening hours. To manage his participants, he needs a software solution to record the details of his participants and batches. Luckily his friend Mike runs a software company. Therefore, Yamin has requested the company to develop a software solution to manage his participants and batches.

The company aims to develop a core Java-based solution using OOPS.

## Tasks:

Perform the below activities as a solution:

1. Create a Java Project in Eclipse.
2. Create a `Participant` Class.
3. Create a `Batch` Class.
4. Create a one-to-many relationship mapping for the `Batch` and `Participant`.
5. Take the inputs from the User using `Scanner` class to create `Participant` and `Batch` objects.
6. Implement method callbacks using run-time polymorphism. When a batch starts, the participant should receive a message.
7. Run the code in the main class.
